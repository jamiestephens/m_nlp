## Minimum Viable Product

My MVP is a simple version of the content based recommender system I am currently working on. 

The engine as it stands right now is a function that uses the CountVectorizer functionality to recommend new books given the input a book the user knows and liked.


Below are examples of the functions using the example book 'Norstrilia'; the output is the ten most relevant books based on the text seen in reviews rating the books between 3 and 5 stars on Goodreads.
