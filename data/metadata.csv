The Lifecycle of Software Objects,Ted Chiang,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7886338-the-lifecycle-of-software-objects,"What's the best way to create artificial intelligence? In 1950 Alan Turing wrote ""Many people think that a very abstract activity like the playing of chess would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named etc. Again I do not know what the right answer is but I think both approaches should be tried.""  The first approach has been tried many times in both science fiction and reality. In this new novella at over 30000 words his longest work to date Ted Chiang offers a detailed imagining of how the second approach might work within the contemporary landscape of startup companies massively-multiplayer online gaming and open-source software.

Age of Miracles,John Brunner,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/882853.Age_of_Miracles,"In Age of Miracles Brunner confronts his characters with an alien transportation system produced by unknown creatures clearly superior in knowledge & application of science. While human characters do learn to make some limited use of the system their position at the end is comparable to that of rats on a sea-going ship & as the characters themselves indicate their future use of the network is predicated on just how annoying these human rats become to the aliens: ""...since we quit pilfering live artefacts the aliens have shown no sign of noticing us. I suspect they can't be bothered. We've put up with rats & mice for thousands of years & we only take steps against them when they cause great harm"" (Ch28). While Age of Miracles doesn't present readers with a unique situation—given the hundreds of works based on confrontation of humans & superior aliens—there are two passages toward the end of the novel which show some highly significant developments in sf writing which can be considered characteristic of more recent interests within the genre. Such passages as a matter of fact provide a strong clue as to Brunner's use of the image of the dystopia. For what has happened in his later work is simply a matter of one image in sf the superior alien being replaced by a new image the dystopia. The 1st passage is a full accounting of what the discovery of the transportation network means for humans. Waldron states: ""We've been desperately trying to make the world seem familiar again. We've been using comparisons & analogs: Den with his rats & mice Orlando with his bushman in a modern city & so on. Finally we have begun to admit that this isn't the same as anything we've run across before. It isn't even like anything else. How could it be? We've been tossed without any warning clear over the horizon of our own past. We calculated the odds were against our being alone in the galaxy. Now we know we're not. We deduced that other stars must have planets. Now we can go & walk on them. It's a clean break. It's killed our past. We can't live in it or by its standards any more. All that counts from now on & forever is the future."" Superficially this passage can be seen as typical of any number of sf works in which man leaves behind the past & faces a brave new tomorrow. There is however a twist in the Age of Miracles which is rare. Man is forced to leave his past not because of his own actions but because the future is imposed upon him. It's not man the seeker of new frontiers who here changes his destiny but man the non-seeker who has his destiny change him. What makes this twist even rarer destiny wasn't even looking for him. Mankind's whole orientation is changed by alien intelligences who have no or almost no awareness of its existence. Mankind may have great new worlds now open to it but they're worlds that have been opened as a side-effect & man can only enjoy these new worlds at a cost of self-esteem. The implications of this passage are very unlike much of the sf of the 30s 40s & even 50s. Justifiably or not when one considers the nature of most sf works one tends to see these works as optimistic about the future. The future implies progress & progress implies a healthy growing race. There are numerous short stories & novels that see humans as a vital race able to triumph over far more sophisticated & knowledgeable aliens because of this vitality. Frequently humanity is portrayed as an upstart race that sweeps all others aside because of its energy & impatience to keep on the move. Such a view however isn't to be found in Age of Miracles. Denying Age of Miracles lacks the optimism of other works doesn't necessarily mean characterizing it as pessimistic. There's a 2nd passage also a speech by Waldron that merits consideration when discussing the 1st. Waldron is about to join a colony on another planet a colony made possible by the use of the alien transportation system. Realizing all new colonies owe their existence to an artifact which is a painfully solid symbol of man's inferior position Waldron ""leaned back in his chair & thought: so rats get on ships...True. & what I'm going to do is much the same. But I'm not going to do it as a rat. I'm going to do it as a man"" (Ch28). Such a statement is optimistic but its optimism is of a different sort than that which has just been characterized. Brunner's optimism stems from an individual not from the race as a whole. When Waldron states he'll act as a man he's actually stating he will act according to what he conceives of as best in mankind; that is being a man is not innately noble. It's behaving as a good man would behave that creates the nobility. One feels that a story about a rat that somehow had won thru to a sense of ""rathood"" & then acted upon that sense would equally impart a tone of optimism for the rest. It's the experience of self-affirmation that's important here a self-affirmation which enables the character to tell all that he is what he is. There are two points to be gained from reading Age of Miracles with implications for all of Brunner's work. The 1st point is concerned with the future. He doesn't assume a future of promise & glory. The optimism of a manifest destiny isn't part of the world he creates. Instead he's far more likely to question the future & man's place in it. The 2nd point is in many ways a consequence of the 1st. Since mankind has no manifest destiny how is man to determine his place in the future if he has any voice in it at all? In Age of Miracles the answer is given: man's place in the future will be determined by individuals who call themselves men. In other words the future of the race is an open question & the solution to that question depends on the people who are part of the race. Three of Brunner's novels are particularly concerned with exactly this issue. Each of these novels Stand on Zanzibar The Sheep Look Up & The Shockwave Rider substitutes the image of a dystopia for the alien in Age of Miracles but the problem remains the same: man must take responsibility for himself & his race.--Stephen H. Goldman (edited)"

Zone One,Colson Whitehead,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10365343-zone-one,In this wry take on the post-apocalyptic horror novel a pandemic has devastated the planet. The plague has sorted humanity into two types: the uninfected and the infected the living and the living dead.  Now the plague is receding and Americans are busy rebuild­ing civilization under orders from the provisional govern­ment based in Buffalo. Their top mission: the resettlement of Manhattan. Armed forces have successfully reclaimed the island south of Canal Street—aka Zone One—but pockets of plague-ridden squatters remain. While the army has eliminated the most dangerous of the infected teams of civilian volunteers are tasked with clearing out a more innocuous variety—the “malfunctioning” stragglers who exist in a catatonic state transfixed by their former lives.  Mark Spitz is a member of one of the civilian teams work­ing in lower Manhattan. Alternating between flashbacks of Spitz’s desperate fight for survival during the worst of the outbreak and his present narrative the novel unfolds over three surreal days as it depicts the mundane mission of straggler removal the rigors of Post-Apocalyptic Stress Disorder and the impossible job of coming to grips with the fallen world.  And then things start to go wrong.  Both spine chilling and playfully cerebral Zone One bril­liantly subverts the genre’s conventions and deconstructs the zombie myth for the twenty-first century.

For one thing genetic errors have crept in with each generation. For another the original three clone ""brothers"" have gone their separate ways and the branches of the family are now friendly rivals more than allies.  Or maybe not so friendly. At least that's what the murder of a North clone in the English city of Newcastle suggests to Detective Sidney Hurst. Sid is a solid investigator who'd like nothing better than to hand off this hot potato of a case. The way he figures it whether he solves the crime or not he'll make enough enemies to ruin his career. Yet Sid's case is about to take an unexpected turn: Because the circumstances of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to a killing that took place years ago on the planet St. Libra where a North clone and his entire household were slaughtered in cold blood.  The convicted slayer Angela Tramelo has always claimed her innocence. And now it seems she may have been right. Because only the St. Libra killer could have committed the Newcastle crime. Problem is Angela also claims that the murderer was an alien monster.  Now Sid must navigate through a Byzantine minefield of competing interests within the police department and the world's political and economic elite...all the while hunting down a brutal killer poised to strike again. And on St. Libra Angela newly released from prison joins a mission to hunt down the elusive alien only to learn that the line between hunter and hunted is a thin one."

The result of genetic experimentation Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training to chip away and find the diamond inside or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.  But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings Peter and Valentine are every bit as unusual as he is but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails."

More Than Human,Theodore Sturgeon,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/541024.More_Than_Human,There's Lone the simpleton who can hear other people's thoughts and make a man blow his brains out just by looking at him. There's Janie who moves things without touching them and there are the teleporting twins who can travel ten feet or ten miles. There's Baby who invented an antigravity engine while still in the cradle and Gerry who has everything it takes to run the world except for a conscience. Separately they are talented freaks. Together they compose a single organism that may represent the next step in evolution and the final chapter in the history of the human race.

For as the protagonists of More Than Human struggle to find who they are and whether they are meant to help humanity or destroy it. Theodore Sturgeon explores questions of power and morality individuality and belonging with suspense pathos and a lyricism rarely seen in science fiction.

A Good Heretic,Becky Chambers,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57148248-a-good-heretic,A novella found in the Infinite Stars: Dark Frontiers anthology.

Infected Sianat are properly called “Pairs” and think of themselves as plural entities. Their pronoun usage reflects this.  In The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet we’re introduced to mainstream Sianat culture through Ohan a Navigator aboard a tunneling ship. However we receive a glimpse of an alternate Sianat way of life through the character Mas who we meet briefly late in the book. This is her story.

Lord have pity on us!""  With these words Pierre Boulle hurtles the reader onto the Planet of the Apes.

The Star Seekers,Milton Lesser,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7617141-the-star-seekers,"Part of the Winston Juvenile Science Fiction Series.  Taken from the cover flap of the novel THE STAR SEEKERS by Milton Lesser:  When man tackles the first really long journey - across twenty-six trillion miles of uncharted space - to the nearest star it will take him two hundred years to complete the flight. Not until the sixth generation nears maturity will the starship reach its destination. Around this fascinating theme Milton Lesser has woven a tale of the first starship's final days of flight. He pictures the ship as a hollowed-out meteorite composed of four concentric circles - a world in which civilization has deteriorated and superstition risen to a high pitch making those within unaware of the fact that they are traveling through space or that their journey is destined to end.  All Mikal knew when he embarked on the ""Journey of the Four Circles"" was that every eighteen-year-old from Astrosphere the outermost circle must visit each of the other circles if he hoped to become an Enginer. But before he completed his trip he unearthed startling truths that threw the four circles into a state of chaos. Gradually Mikal discovered that unless the people of the four circles took immediate action the ship was doomed to crash. Mikal's desperate efforts to unite the four circles in order to save their world is a story of rising tension and clashing interests.  Not only is this a tale of man's triumph over the barriers of space but a fabulously exciting epic of civilization's victory over superstition and complacency. With subtle satire the author has written one of the most realistic and unforgettable stories ever to appear in the science fiction field."

The very best will graduate as ""poets"" adept wielders of language who belong to a nameless organization that is as influential as it is secretive.  Whip-smart orphan Emily Ruff is making a living running a three-card Monte game on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organization's recruiters. She is flown across the country for the school's strange and rigorous entrance exams where once admitted she will be taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte Eliot and Lowell--who have adopted the names of famous poets to conceal their true identities. For in the organization nothing is more dangerous than revealing who you are: Poets must never expose their feelings lest they be manipulated.

Meanwhile a seemingly innocent man named Wil Jamieson is brutally ambushed by two strange men in an airport bathroom.

As the two narratives converge the shocking work of the poets is fully revealed the body count rises and the world crashes toward a Tower of Babel event which would leave all language meaningless. A brilliant thriller that connects very modern questions of privacy identity and the rising obsession of data collection to centuries-old ideas about the power of language and coercion Lexicon is Max Barry's most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet."

Thirteen,Richard K. Morgan,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40448.Thirteen,The future isn’t what it used to be since Richard K. Morgan arrived on the scene.

Dick Award in the process. In Market Forces he launched corporate gladiator Chris Faulkner into the brave new business of war-for-profit. Now in Thirteen Morgan radically reshapes and recharges science fiction yet again with a new and unforgettable hero in Carl Marsalis: hybrid hired gun and a man without a country . . . or a planet.  Marsalis is one of a new breed. Literally. Genetically engineered by the U.S. government to embody the naked aggression and primal survival skills that centuries of civilization have erased from humankind Thirteens were intended to be the ultimate military fighting force. The project was scuttled however when a fearful public branded the supersoldiers dangerous mutants dooming the Thirteens to forced exile on Earth’s distant desolate Mars colony. But Marsalis found a way to slip back–and into a lucrative living as a bounty hunter and hit man before a police sting landed him in prison–a fate worse than Mars and much more dangerous.  Luckily his “enhanced” life also seems to be a charmed one. A new chance at freedom beckons courtesy of the government. All Marsalis has to do is use his superior skills to bring in another fugitive. But this one is no common criminal. He’s another Thirteen–one who’s already shanghaied a space shuttle butchered its crew and left a trail of bodies in his wake on a bloody cross-country spree. And like his pursuer he was bred to fight to the death. Still there’s no question Marsalis will take the job. Though it will draw him deep into violence treachery corruption and painful confrontation with himself anything is better than remaining a prisoner. The real question is: can he remain sane–and alive–long enough to succeed?  2007 1st Ed Del Rey 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Nineteen Eighty-Four,"George Orwell, Thomas Pynchon (Foreword)",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5471.Nineteen_Eighty_Four,"The new novel by George Orwell is the major work towards which all his previous writing has pointed. Critics have hailed it as his ""most solid most brilliant"" work. Though the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four takes place thirty-five years hence it is in every sense timely. The scene is London where there has been no new housing since 1950 and where the city-wide slums are called Victory Mansions. Science has abandoned Man for the State. As every citizen knows only too well war is peace.  To Winston Smith a young man who works in the Ministry of Truth (Minitru for short) come two people who transform this life completely. One is Julia whom he meets after she hands him a slip reading ""I love you."" The other is O'Brien who tells him ""We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness."" The way in which Winston is betrayed by the one and against his own desires and instincts ultimately betrays the other makes a story of mounting drama and suspense.

A quarter of a century later in a world shaped by what's now known as ""Haden's syndrome"" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel with a suspect who is an ""integrator"" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.  But ""complicated"" doesn't begin to describe it.

Within half a decade that serial would make history as the basis of the first science fiction movie about interstellar travel and interstellar war. The next Hollywood movie to venture to another solar system was Forbidden Planet a wholly original construct of the prestige studio MGM. But solid reliable Universal Studios was there first...long before Star Trek.This Island Earth was really the first Star Wars. Colorful spectacular wildly imaginative it lived up to everything its agent could possibly want a man who was known as Mr. Science Fiction and who now brings back this classic novel: Forrest J Ackerman. A phrase he coined in another galaxy a long time ago say's it all: Gosh Wow This story has it all.  The cover of this special edition features Jeff Morrow in the role of one of the most sympathetic aliens in 1950's science fiction film (the other is Michael Rennie in The Day the Earth Stood Still also adapted from a literary source). In the novel he is Jorgasnovara in the movie the less jaw Breaking Exeter. In both print and celluloid he comes to respect the Earth scientists essayed by Rex Reason and Faith Domergue.  This Island Earth is a book of heroes. The first half of the film closely follows the novel but then diverges from the intellectual challenges faced by Dr. Cal Meachem to more cinematic fare. Reading the novel now one cannot help but marvel at how Jones' views everything from labor disputes to the predictability of computers influenced later movies and television making This Island Earth the novel even more influential than-one would guess from ThisIslandEarth the movie.  Pulpless.Com is proud to bring back the printed word in hope that all who see the movie will want to read the book and vice versa Turn on your interocitors and prepare to receive transmission

A Working Theory of Love,Scott Hutchins,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588444-a-working-theory-of-love,Settled back into the San Francisco singles scene following the implosion of his young marriage just months after the honeymoon Neill Bassett is going through the motions. His carefully modulated routine however is soon disrupted in ways he can’t dismiss with his usual nonchalance.  When Neill’s father committed suicide ten years ago he left behind thousands of pages of secret journals journals that are stunning in their detail and it must be said their complete banality. But their spectacularly quotidian details were exactly what artificial intelligence company Amiante Systems was looking for and Neill was able to parlay them into a job despite a useless degree in business marketing and absolutely no experience in computer science. He has spent the last two years inputting the diaries into what everyone hopes will become the world’s first sentient computer. Essentially he has been giving it language—using his father’s words. Alarming to Neill—if not to the other employees of Amiante—the experiment seems to be working. The computer actually appears to be gaining awareness and most disconcerting of all has started asking questions about Neill’s childhood.  Amid this psychological turmoil Neill meets Rachel. She was meant to be a one-night stand but Neill is unexpectedly taken with her and the possibilities she holds. At the same time he remains preoccupied by unresolved feelings for his ex-wife who has a talent for appearing at the most unlikely and unfortunate times. When Neill discovers a missing year in the diaries—a year that must hold some secret to his parents’ marriage and perhaps even his father’s suicide—everything Neill thought he knew about his past comes into question and every move forward feels impossible to make.  With a lightness of touch that belies pitch-perfect emotional control Scott Hutchins takes us on an odyssey of love grief and reconciliation that shows us how once we let go of the idea that we’re trapped by our own sad histories—our childhoods our bad decisions our miscommunications with those we love—we have the chance to truly be free. A Working Theory of Love marks the electrifying debut of a prodigious new talent.

Barefoot in the Head,Brian W. Aldiss,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462550.Barefoot_in_the_Head,When an undeclared Acid Head War breaks out Britain is the first to be devastated by Psycho-Chemical Aerosols--tasteless odourless colourless psychedelic drugs which distort the minds of thousands of civilians into extreme terror or extreme joy. When the warped citizens of Europe proclaim Colin Charteris their hero he finds himself leading an unfathomable crusade in a devastated world. Perhaps Aldiss's most experimental work this first appeared in several parts as the 'Acid Head War' series in New Worlds. Set in a Europe some years after a flare-up in the Middle East led to Europe being attacked with bombs releasing huge quantities of long-lived hallucinogenic drugs. Into an England with a population barely maintaining a grip on reality comes a young Serb who himself starts coming under the influence of the ambient aerosols & finds himself leading a messianic crusade. The narration & dialog reflects the shattering of language under the influence of the drugs in mutating phrases & puns & allusions in a deliberate echo of Finnegans Wake.--Wikipedia

Glory Road,Robert A. Heinlein,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50856.Glory_Road,"E. C. ""Scar"" Gordon was on the French Riviera recovering from a tour of combat in Southeast Asia  but he hadn't given up his habit of scanning the Personals in the newspaper.

He must be 23 to 25 years old in perfect health at least six feet tall weigh about 190 pounds fluent English with some French proficient in all weapons some knowledge of engineering and mathematics essential willing to travel no family or emotional ties indomitably courageous and handsome of face and figure. Permanent employment very high pay glorious adventure great danger. You must apply in person rue Dante Nice 2me étage apt. D.""  How could you not answer an ad like that especially when it seemed to describe you perfectly? Well except maybe for the ""handsome"" part but that was in the eye of the beholder anyway. So he went to that apartment and was greeted by the most beautiful woman he'd ever met. She seemed to have many names but agreed he could call her ""Star."" A pretty appropriate name as it turned out for the empress of twenty universes.  Robert A. Heinlein's one true fantasy novel Glory Road is as much fun today as when he wrote it after Stranger in a Strange Land. Heinlein proves himself as adept with sword and sorcery as with rockets and slide rules and the result is exciting satirical fast-paced funny and tremendously readable -- a favorite of all who have read it. Glory Road is a masterpiece of escapist entertainment with a typically Heinleinian sting in its tail. Tor is proud to return this all-time classic to hardcover to be discovered by a new generation of readers."

Clarke of Last and First Men. This masterpiece of science fiction by British philosopher and writer Olaf Stapledon (1886–1950) is an imaginative ambitious history of humanity's future that spans billions of years.

It evolves through the ages: rising to pinnacles of civilization teetering on the brink of extinction surviving onslaughts from other planets and a decline in solar energy and constantly developing new forms new senses and new intellectual abilities.

As sure as Ferrer Burgoyne was an astronaut the new men of Earth were the descendants of those hidden forbidden experiments.  How then could Burgoyne continue his mission: to defoliate Earth with the deadly chemical Deep Green and prepare Earth for the return of his species?

Mysterious uncommunicative and relentlessly bent on humanity's extinction the Fallers have mastered the star gates and are closing in on earth. Dr. Bazargan commands the scientific team sent to a newly discovered world to study its humanoid natives: beings who literally perceive only one reality. To lie is to be unreal--and condemned to death. The humans must flee for their lives across the unknown planet when they and the aliens learn the scientific mission is a lie.

The sequel Probability Sun will appear in 2001 and the concluding book will be The Fabric of Space. --Cynthia Ward"

The Separation,Christopher Priest,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106921.The_Separation,"Christopher Priest excels at rethinking SF themes lifting them above genre expectations into his own tricky chilling metaphysically dangerous territory. The Separation suggests an alternate history lying along a road not taken in World War II. But there are complications. In 1999 history author Stuart Gratton is intrigued by a minor mystery of the European war which ended on 10 May 1941. The British-German armistice signed that month has had far-reaching consequences including a resettlement of European Jews in Madagascar. In 1936 the identical twin brothers Joe and Jack Sawyer win a rowing medal for Britain in the Berlin Olympics: it's presented to them by Rudolf Hess. The brothers are separated not only by a twin's fierce need ""to be treated as a separate human being"" but by sexual rivalry and even ideology. When war breaks out Jack becomes a gung-ho bomber pilot Joe a conscientious objector. Still they're inescapably linked and sometimes confused. Both suffer injuries and hauntingly similar ambulance journeys. Churchill writes a puzzled memo (later unearthed by Gratton) about the anomaly of a registered-pacifist Red Cross worker flying planes for Bomber Command. Hess has significant eventually incompatible meetings with both men. Contradictions are everywhere. As in his magical 1995 novel The Prestige Priest is fruitfully fascinated by the legerdemain of twins doubles impostors symmetrical roles. Churchill's double briefly appears. So does the famous conspiracy theory that the Hess who flew to Britain with his quixotic peace deal wasn't the real Hess ring true? Clearly The Separation was impressively extensively researched. Its evocations of bombing raids--from either side of the bomb sites--are memorable. The unfolding story strands become increasingly disorienting and hallucinatory; the easy escape route of dismissing one strand as delusion is itself subtly undermined. The Separation is filled with a sense of the precariousness of history; of small events and choices with extraordinary consequences. --David Langford"

In London on a job she is offered a secret assignment: to investigate some intriguing snippets of video that have been appearing on the Internet.

Earthly matter composed of the classical four elements of earth air fire and water naturally moves in straight lines. Heavenly matter naturally rises and moves in circles. This is the universe as understood by the ancient Greeks.  The science of the ancient Chinese also applies but as the novel is told from the perspective of the Greeks it is less well understood. Xi the Chinese notion of spirit and flow can be manipulated to move objects and energy. The Chinese five elements of earth metal water wood and fire are transmuted one into the other.

In this world the Delian League (Greeks) and Middle Kingdom (Chinese) have been fighting a war for nearly a thousand years ever since the time of Alexander the Great when the warrior-culture of Sparta and the Athenian Akademe were fused into a half-world conquering force.

En dat is nodig want op de maan zijn vreemsoortige koepels waargenomen. De astronomen weten er geen raad mee. Foto's kunnen misschien uitkomst brengen maar door de dampkring is het resultaat niet bevredigend. Er zal iemand boven de dampkring moeten uitstijgen en van daar foto's nemen. En die iemand zal flink en doortastend moeten zijn voor geen kleintje vervaard en... klein van stuk. Want er is slechts een kleine raket beschikbaar. Tijd om een grote te bouwen is er niet meer. Chris Godfrey die net het eindexamen van de middelbare school gedaan heeft is zo iemand. Hij is klein van stuk maar daartegenover staat dat hij over een enorm doorzettingsvermogen beschikt. In het geheim - want overal kunnen spionnen loeren - wordt hij getraind voor zijn gevaarlijke tocht. Op de raketbasis Woomera merkt hij dat er geheizinnige dingen gebeuren - hij weet zeker dat er ergens een spion van een vreemde mogendheid zit. Maar wie die spion nu precies is beseft hij pas als hij in zijn raket duizenden kilometers boven de aarde zweeft en het opwindendste uitzicht op de maan heeft dat hij zich maar had durven dromen. Zal de dappere Chris met zijn waardevolle foto's weer heelhuids op aarde terugkeren? Of zal de spion op het allerlaatste moment roet in het eten gooien?  Jongens van 12-16 jaar.

Andymon: Eine Weltraum-Utopie,"Angela Steinmüller, Karlheinz Steinmüller, Erik Simon",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6279653-andymon,Als Andymon der erste Roman von Angela und Karlheinz Steinmüller 1982 erschien löste er unter Science-Fiction-Lesern in der DDR wahre Begeisterungsstürme aus. Noch 1989 wurde er bei einer Leserumfrage zum beliebtesten ostdeutschen Science-Fiction-Roman gewählt. Als zweiter Band innerhalb der Steinmüller-Werkausgabe ist Andymon nun in einer von den Autoren überarbeiteten Neufassung wieder erhältlich ergänzt um ein ausführliches Nachwort. Ein automatisch gesteuertes Raumschiff befindet sich seit tausenden von Jahren auf dem Weg zu einem Planeten der die nötigen Voraussetzungen für die menschliche Besiedlung bietet. Nach all der Zeit beginnt sich in seinem Inneren nun wieder der Funke des Lebens zu regen. Der Junge Beth ist einer der ersten Menschen die aus eingefrorenen Eizellen das Licht der Welt erblicken aufgezogen von Robotern und behütet vom Schiffscomputer. Doch bevor Beth und seine Geschwister die Steuerung des Schiffes übernehmen können müssen sie sich mit dem Wissen ganzer Generationen vertraut machen das in den Datenbanken des Computers gespeichert ist. Bei ihrer Ankunft erweist sich die neue Heimat Andymon als karge Wüste mit einer für Menschen giftigen Atmosphäre. All ihre Kräfte und Fähigkeiten werden nötig sein um aus dem Planeten das blühende Paradies zu machen das sie sich seit langem erträumen. Doch das ist längst nicht die einzige Herausforderung der sich Beth und seine Gefährten gegenüber sehen. Nachfolgende Generationen jüngerer Geschwister haben gänzlich eigene Vorstellungen über die Form der Besiedlung des Planeten die den Erfolg des gesamten Vorhabens in Frage stellen. Trotz seines Ursprungs in den 1970er-Jahren wirken die Themen des Romans erstaunlich zeitlos. So geht es um das Verhältnis von Natur und Technik ebenso wie um die Möglichkeit den verschiedensten menschlichen Lebensentwürfen in einer offenen Gesellschaft gerecht zu werden. Obwohl Andymon eine positive Utopie schildert ist der Roman weit davon entfernt vorgefertigte Antworten zu liefern. Gerade die offen bleibenden Fragen sind es die den Leser fesseln und zum Nachdenken anregen. Ein Klassiker der deutschsprachigen Science Fiction der seine Faszination bis heute nicht verloren hat! --Steffi Pritzens

"The Haunted Stars (Vintage Pyramid Sf, F 698)",Edmond Hamilton,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2633939-the-haunted-stars,It meant little to Robert Fairlie a serious and dedicated young philologist that the United States and Soviet Russia were at odds about the Moon. He had little interest in the first rocket landings or the bases that the two nations had established there. And he neither knew nor cared why the Americans would not agree to mutual inspections of these bases.   Yet the Americans had reason enough: and quite unexpectedly because of his specialised knowledge of languages he found himself sharing the burden of an incredible secret. For what the American base had yielded was astounding evidence that space had already been conquered many centuries before by a people who had once spanned the stars. There had been machines and destructive weapons beyond the comprehension of present-day scientists which if knowledge of them fell into the wrong hands could plunge the world into unutterable chaos.   Fairlie's trip to the closely-guarded rocket base in New Mexico turned out to be only the first step on a fantastic journey amid the unexplored stars to the home-world of the space-conquerors of long ago.   It was a journey into the appalling reality of stellar space still haunted by the past cosmic struggle whose scale in space and time dwarfed the rivalries of tiny Earth's quarreling nations.

Lucy is a minor daughter in one of those families; her parents were both leading figures in the group that overthrew Churchill and negotiated peace with Herr Hitler eight years before.  Despite her parents' evident disapproval Lucy is married — happily — to a London Jew. It was therefore quite a surprise to Lucy when she and her husband David found themselves invited to the retreat. It's even more startling when on the retreat's first night a major politician of the Farthing set is found gruesomely murdered with abundant signs that the killing was ritualistic.  It quickly becomes clear to Lucy that she and David were brought to the retreat in order to pin the murder on him. Major political machinations are at stake including an initiative in Parliament supported by the Farthing set to limit the right to vote to university graduates.  But whoever's behind the murder and the frame-up didn't reckon on the principal investigator from Scotland Yard being a man with very private reasons for sympathizing with outcasts… and looking beyond the obvious. As the trap slowly shuts on Lucy and David they begin to see a way out — a way fraught with peril in a darkening world."

Rappaccini's Daughter,"Nathaniel Hawthorne, Simon Schama (Foreword)",https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1048676.Rappaccini_s_Daughter,Taking up his place at the University of Padua the youthful Giovanni Guasconti is enchanted to discover a nearby garden of the most exquisite beauty. In it abides a young woman perhaps the most beautiful Giovanni has ever seen. Yet as he looks out from an upstairs window he soon learns that far from stemming from the gentle hand of Mother Nature the garden - and the matchless Beatrice - are in fact the result of a monstrous abomination of creativity.  Part fairy tale part Gothic horror story Hawthorne's 'Rappaccini's Daughter' is an inspired tale of creation and control and an ingenious biblical parody. Its fantastical element is brilliantly echoed in the two other short stories contained in this volume: 'Young Goodman Brown' sees one of Salem's townsmen introduced to a dark ceremony of diabolic intent whilst 'A Select Party' tells of a magical party set in a castle in the sky and attended by a host of glittering guests.  Read together these three short stories exemplify Hawthorne's key thematic concerns and display all his art as a storyteller. --front flap

Only David Raven - and a few others like him - knew about the Denebians. But Raven had powers no human or mutant had every[sic] dreamed of and he was looking out for humanity... [From Back cover] [Front Page] Pawn to King  The notion of a supertelepathic superlevitator was patently absurd - but the opposition would swallow the absurdity when it came along in the guise of a self-evident fact. There would be considerable boosting of blood pressure in the hidden Venusian hierarchy when they learned that the first act of Earth's new chess piece was to abolish a natural law.

But at least he'd created considerable uneasiness in the ranks of the formerly overconfident enemy. Indeed if they had bolted this multitalent mutant notion and speculated on the dire possibility of still more formidable types yet to come they would have every reason to feel afraid.  It was a pity they could not be told the truth.

World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,Max Brooks,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8908.World_War_Z,"The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men women and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living or at least the undead hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance that gripped human society through the plague years.  Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold to the United States of Southern Africa where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.  Most of all the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader but the effort is invaluable because as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction ""By excluding the human factor aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may heaven forbid lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""  Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission."
